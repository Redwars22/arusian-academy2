## ALPT D

### LU-PEI/TEI-LU (WE)

In Arusian we usually distinguish whether we are including the listener or not when using the **WE** pronoun. **LU-PEI** means you are excluding the listener (THEM AND I but not YOU) and **TEI-LU** means YOU and I.

**Lu-pei tr pai-tek** (We go to school - I and them)

**Nepa-tei-lu ouwr tei-lu dauwas** (Don't we want to eat? - You and me)

### ~R VERBS (ACTOR OR ACTIVE)

When the verb has a subject (an actor) who acts upon an object (the patient), it ends in **-R**. Both the subject and the object have to be present when using these type of verbs.

**Tei-lu demr Anglei-dem u rmr Keyaya-dei** (We speak English with Keyaya)

**Lu auwemr TV** (I'm watching TV)

**Tei auwemr ayau-vai** (You are watching movies)

**Lu auwr sru** (I see a cat)

### ~SE VERBS (PATIENT OR PASSIVE)

We use **-SE** when we want to focus on the object. It's kind of passive voice in English (e.g.: the food was eaten by the cat), but in this kind of "passive", both the actor/agent and the object must be present in the sentence.

**Lu auwse Pauwa-dei** (I'm seen by Pauwa)

**Anglei-dem demse anglei-vo** (English is spoken by the English)

**Nut dauwse sru** (The food is eaten by the cat)

**Sru ause lu** (The cat was seen by me)

### ADVERBS OF TIME
You will now learn how to tell the time when an action takes place (today, now, yesterday, tomorrow). You just add them at the end of the sentence. **U SA TRA PUS** (today), **U SA WEL PUS** (now), **U SA MREGRA-TRA** (yesterday), **U SA TREGRA-TRA** (tomorrow).

**Vej sa lu tekr Japonei-dem u sa tra pus** (I didn't study Japanese today)

**Vej sa sru dauwr nut u sa mregra-tra** (The cat didn't eat food yesterday)

**Nepa-tei ouwr tei tr fai-fai u rmr ma teis u sa tregra-tra** (Do you want to go to the forest with your parents tomorrow?)

**Puwei-pai teis u sa wel pus** (Where are you now?)

### PUWEI-SEG~ (WHEN...?)

You add **PUWEI-SEG** to the beginning of the sentence to ask **WHEN** an action happens, happened or will happen. **SEG** is a noun meaning 'time'.

**Puwei-seg sa tei tr mez lus** (When are you coming to my house?)

**Puwei-seg sa tei delr tei puwauwas** (When can you read?)

### PUWEI-KEI (WHY...?)

You add **PUWEI-KEI** to the beginning of the sentence to ask **WHEN** an action happens, happened or will happen. **KEI** is a noun meaning 'reason'.

**Puwei-kei sa vej sa tei demr-rmr lu** (Why don't you talk to me?)

### KOR (TO DO SOMETHING, TO ACT, TO WORK)

This verb is used for 'to do something', 'to create', 'to do an action', and 'to work'. It works the same as the **-R** verbs we saw before. You can also add nouns as objects after eat for actions that produce something as a result (e.g.: cooking).

**Lu kor vreyek otras** (I do many things)

**Tei kor nut** (You are cooking food)

**Tei kor kai** (You are doing/creating art)

### KEISE, U KEISE (BECAUSE)

This expression is used to give an explanation, aka. a reason, for something happening. It works like 'because' in English. It literally means 'caused by'. The order is `FACT/STATEMENT + u keise + EXPLANATION/REASON`.

**Lu demr-rmr tei u keise lu amr tei** (I talk to you because I like/befriend you)

**Vej sa tei amr lu u keise vej sa lu kamr um otras** (You don't like me because I don't have a lot of money)

Another use of **KEISE** is 'caused by':

This verb expresses 'needs' and 'requirements' in Arusian. 

**Lu agr lu dauwas** (I need to eat)

**Lu agr lu demr-rmr tei** (I need to talk to you)

**Lu agr nut u sa wel pus** (I need food now)

### NRA (A FEW, FEW, A LITTLE OF)

We place it either before or after the noun, but we have to add the SA particle to the 2nd noun. It depends on what you want to emphasize.

**Nra juwas** (Books are few, scarcity of books)

### VOT (ALL, EVERY, EACH)

**Vom sa vot** (All the people)

**Vot sa vom** (The [group] of people/each of the people/every single person) 

### X USU Y (X OR Y)
