### NUMBERS

You will easily recognize Arusian numerals because they always have the root **PEI**, used for counting. A fun fact is that most Arusian numerals come from nouns. For example, **KAU** means *insect*, but **PEI-KAU** means *six*. Numbers are flexible and can either precede or follow the noun. Since they behave like nouns too, they need the **SA** copula between the noun and the numeral. Like most world's languages, it is also a base-10 system, so don't worry.

|Roma-Sem|Semlek|Indo-Arabic|
|---|---|---|
|**pei-vej**|<RenderSemlek phrase={"Pa, vej"}/>|0|
|**pei-at** or **pei-ka**|<RenderSemlek phrase={"Pa, aT . Pa, ka"}/>|1|
|**pei-ta**|<RenderSemlek phrase={"Pa, ta"}/>|2|
|**pei-tef**|<RenderSemlek phrase={"Pa, tef"}/>|3|
|**pei-kef** or **pei-pek**|<RenderSemlek phrase={"Pa, kef . Pa, Pec"}/>|4|
|**pei-mei** or **pei-kam**|<RenderSemlek phrase={"Pa, Ma, . Pa, kam"}/>|5|
|**pei-kau**|<RenderSemlek phrase={"Pa, kao"}/>|6|
|**pei-aek**|<RenderSemlek phrase={"Pa, aec"}/>|7|
|**pei-lei**|<RenderSemlek phrase={"Pa, la,"}/>|8|
|**pei-ara**|<RenderSemlek phrase={"Pa, ara"}/>|9|
|**pei-ta-mei**|<RenderSemlek phrase={"Pa, ta Ma,"}/>|10|

To form numbers between 11 and 19, just add **-DA-TA-MEI** (literally PLUS TWO TIMES FIVE) after the 1-9 digits. For example:

- 19: **pei-ara-da-ta-mei** <RenderSemlek phrase={"Pa, ara da ta Ma,"}/>

- 16: **pei-kau-da-ta-mei** <RenderSemlek phrase={"Pa, kao da ta Ma,"}/>

- 13: **pei-tef-da-ta-mei** <RenderSemlek phrase={"Pa, tef da ta Ma,"}/>

For numbers 20-90, add **-TA-MEI** after 2-9:

- 20: **pei-ta-ta-mei** <RenderSemlek phrase={"Pa, ta ta Ma,"}/>

- 40: **pei-kef-ta-mei** <RenderSemlek phrase={"Pa, kef ta Ma,"}/>

- 90: **pei-ara-ta-mei** <RenderSemlek phrase={"Pa, ara ta Ma,"}/>

For numbers 21-99, you begin with the 1-9 digits, add **-DA-** and then add the multiples of 10:

- 93: **pei-tef-da-ara-ta-mei** <RenderSemlek phrase={"Pa, tef da ara ta Ma,"}/>

- 44: **pei-kef-da-kef-ta-mei** <RenderSemlek phrase={"Pa, kef da kef ta Ma,"}/>

- 33: **pei-tef-da-tef-ta-mei** <RenderSemlek phrase={"Pa, tef da tef ta Ma,"}/>

100 is **PEI-DEK** and for 200-900 you add the digits 2-9 before **DEK**:

- 300: **pei-tef-dek** <RenderSemlek phrase={"Pa, tef dec"}/>

- 500: **pei-mei-dek** <RenderSemlek phrase={"Pa, Ma, dec"}/>


1000 is **PEI-TA-MEI-DEK** (2X5X100). 

### MEASURING AND COUNTING THINGS

To count things in Arusian, we can add the numeral either before or after the noun and you mustn't forget the **SA** copula between them. This group of words will behave like any other kind of clause in Arusian and will follow/require the rules of usage of **U** and **WEI** whenever needed.

<RenderSemlek phrase={"lru sa Pa, kam"}/>

**Lru sa pei-kam** (Five dogs, the dog [is what is] five)

<RenderSemlek phrase={"vej sa Fna del kamr vo.m sa Pa, ta Ma, dec"}/>

**Vej sa Fna-del kamr vom sa pei-ta-mei-dek** (Fenadel doesn't have 1000 people)

### DATES

For days of the month, you just prefix **TRA** to the number (it means day). For full dates, such as 'February 17th', just add **SA** between the elements.

<RenderSemlek phrase={"vej sa lu tr Fna del u seGr tra aec da ta Ma, sa Nru klua"}/>

**Vej sa lu tr Fna-del u segr tra-17 sa nru-kluwa** (I'm not going to Fenadel on February 17th)

<RenderSemlek phrase={"Fna aru sa ej keGse u seGr tra tef ta Ma, sa Nru aa,"}/>

**Fna-aru sa ej kegse u segr tra-31 sa nru-ai** (Arusia celebrates freedom on May 31th)

### YEARS

Years in Arusian often use the **GAU** prefix before the numerals. For example, 2025 is **GAU-2025**. 'IN THE YEAR OF 2025' is **U SEGR GAU-2025**, behaving like any other type of adverb.

### WEI IN PREDICATES (SPECIAL PRONOUN)

WEI is a pronoun that adds more information to a clause (what in English are noun phrases are actually clauses in Arusian. For example: big dog is 'the dog is the thing that is big' in Arusian, implying that it is a clause) belonging to a predicate/comment. It is similar to U, but, unlike it, it doesn't add information to a topic.

<RenderSemlek phrase={"jua sa klua vaa, u sa vel auaea,s ua, pus ua, drejr"}/>

**Juwa sa kluwa-vai u sa vel auwayeis wei pus wei drejr** (As for the white book, the woman [is the one that is] beautiful [which is the one that is] here bought [it])

This can be loosely translated as the English _which_ or _that_ when they refer back to clauses. Like in: **The book is white, _which_ I find interesting.** While in English this is an emphatic way of speaking, in Arusian this structure is used all the time.

<RenderSemlek phrase={" jua sa klua vaa, u sa lu ouaor"}/> 

**Juwa sa kluwa-vai u sa lu ouwauwr** (I find the white book interesting).

<RenderSemlek phrase={"NuT daos r, lru sa klua vaa, ua, Pus"}/>

**Nut dause lru sa kluwa-vai wei pus** (The food was eaten by the white dog which is here).

<RenderSemlek phrase={"Faa, Faa, sa Fna del u trs r, vo.m oTras ua, trmr vo ah sh eh "}/>

**Fai-fai sa fna-del u trse vom otras wei trmr vo-Asei** (The forest of Fenadel was visited by many Asian people/by many people which are Asian).

:::info
**Vom otras wei trmr vo-Asei** is literally translated as 'the people [are the ones who are] many, which are Asian**, which _which_ here refering back to _the people [are the ones who are] many_, which is a clause. 
:::

:::warning
Don't confuse **U** and **WEI** with relative pronouns because they refer back to clauses in Arusian, not nouns.
:::

### IF/ELSE

Arusian has no direct equivalent of the English structure **IF/ELSE**. However, the closest you can get is this:

- First you add the hypothesis, the action that, if or when it occurs, will lead to the second action happening.

- You add **U KEYR** between the first action and the action or event that results from it.

For the sense of **ELSE** (negative result), you add **USU-VEJ SA** to the beginning of the sentence.

Examples:

<RenderSemlek phrase={"ta, tecras sa sa oTra u ka,r Ta, sa umra, ko aems r, . usu vej sa umra, ko sa ta, aemr"}/>

- **[Tei tekras sasa otra] u keyr [tei sa umrei-ko aemse]. Usu-vej sa [umrei-ko sa tei aemr]** (If you study a lot you will find a job. Else, you won't find a job)

:::warning
The literal translation of this sentence is: 'you studying a lot causes you to be the one for whom a job is found. Otherwise/If no job is the thing that you find'
:::

This structure works best for this kind of situation: action one triggers action or even two. Else, it triggers a negative result.

<RenderSemlek phrase={"ta, ucra,s u ka,r Pa, uc sa ta, aGr ta, tr . usu vej sa ta, Noua,s"}/>

- **Tei ukreis u keyr pai-uk sa tei agr tei tr. Usu-vej sa tei nouweis** (If you are sick you have to go to the hospital. Or else, you will die)

### VOCATIVES

Vocatives are used when calling someone or drawing their attention. In Arusian, we prefix **U** to the name of the person we are calling.

<RenderSemlek phrase={"u kaea"}/>

**U-Kaya** (Hey, Kaya! Oh, Kaya!) 

<RenderSemlek phrase={"u kaea . Nepa lu sa ta, aor u Pus"}/>

**U-Kaya. Nepa-lu sa tei auwr u pus** (Hey, Kaya! Don't you see me here?)

<RenderSemlek phrase={"u juea . Nepa ta, treGras u sa tra araraas"}/>

**U-Juweya. Nepa-tei tregras u sa tra araraas** (Juweya, Are You coming tomorrow?)

<RenderSemlek phrase={"u Paua . Paa, lac trs r, ta, lu "}/>

**U-Pauwa. Pai-lak trse tei-lu** (Pauwa, we are going to the market)

<RenderSemlek phrase={"u su tecra lus . vej sa uaa, No"}/>

**U-su-tekra lus. Vej sa waai-no** (My student, nothing is eternal)

### FAUWR

The verb **FAUWR** in Arusian is used to express that something is in a certain state. One of the fixed usages of it is with **U FAUWR** for languges. Example:

- **Juwa semreis u fauwr Anglei-dem** (The book was written in English).

<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>

In the examples below, it expresses the state in which something is:

**Vom otras u kijras u sa tara-del fauwr** (The capital is in a state of many people vandalizing)

<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>

**Leyem umuuweis u sa so-pei fauwr** (They are greatly in a state of love)

<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>

**Uwaai sa luwed u sa tara pus wei fauwr** (This city is in a state of being without order)

<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>

:::warning
**WEI** is used here because it is modifying a predicate element (a clause) that isn't the topic. The same for the sentence below.
:::

**Tara-del sa luwa waais wei fause** (The capital is in a state of being without water)

<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>

:::info
The difference between **TRMR** and **FAUWR** is that **TRMR** translates to _'to be a type of'_, while **FAUWR** means _'to be in the state of'_.
:::

### IT HURTS VS SOMEONE HURTS ME

To say that some part of your body hurts, you can say **LAREI PRMR + PART OF THE BODY**. To say that someone hurts you, just use the verb **PRMR**. For the feeling of being hurt or being in trouble, **PRMREIS** is a good choice.

**Larei prmr kara lus** (My head hurts)

<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>

**Lu sa tei prmr** (You hurt me)

<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>

**Lu prmreis** (I'm in trouble)

<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>

### U EDR...

**U EDR** introduces both the receiver of something and the person who benefits from something. **EDR** on its own is a verb meaning "to help". This is how Arusian expresses the concept of 'to/for'.

### CAUSATIVE VERBS

In Arusian, the concept of causing someone to do something is expressed by the verb **KOR** (which carries some uncertainty about whether the person will do the action or not) or the verb **KEYR** (which implies the person will definitely do the action someone caused them to do).

**Ayau-vai u sa lu kor tei auwr** (I made you watch the movie)

<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>

**Ayau-vai u sa lu keyr tei auwr** (I made you watch the movie - and the action definitely happened)

<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>

### DISCOURSE MARKERS: ALU AND UKEI

Both **ALU** and **UKEI** are discourse markers and modify the tone of the sentence and/or add additional meaning to them. **ALU** is like English 'so, thus, therefore', while **UKEI** expresses surprise or shock. In Roma-sem, you always write a dash between the particle and the first word of the sentence.

**Alu-vej sa luwa otras wei sa lei-luwa kamr** (Therefore, a river doesn't have a lot of water)

<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>

**Ukei-su sa tei ouwr** (You liked it?!)

<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>

### MORE USEFUL ADVERBS AND SENTENCE MODIFIERS

|Expression | Example (Roma-Sem) | Example (Semlek) | English | 
|---|---|---|---|
|**sasa tuwek** (immediately)|**Marei kouwas sasa tuwek**|<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>|Act immediately!|
|**Geyei sa...** (it seems to...)|**Geyei sa vej sa so leyemr lu**|<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>|It seems she doesn't love me|
|**Vej sa...wei deyayeis** (it's impossible to...)|**Vej sa tu das wei tumr vai wei deyayeis**|<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>|It's impossible to go faster than light|
|**Vreyek sayr...** (Things like...)|**Vreyek sayr tek u sa lu veyor**|<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>|I don't like things like school/related to school|
|**Vreyek keyor...** (Things like...)|**Lu ouwr vreyek keyor kluwa otras**|<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>|I like colorful-like things|
|**Tuwa-kej** (for example)|**Tuwa-kej. "Tei sa lu auwr"**|<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>|For example: I see you|
|**U sa tuwa-kej** (for example)|**Vom delr su auwas u sa tuwa-kej**|<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>|People can see, for example|
|**Paai sa...* (still)|**Paai sa lu semr grau das**|<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>|I'm still writing more messages|
|**Umu-lo sa... fauwr**|**Umu-lo sa tei fauwr**|<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>|You are far away|
|**...u pa(ai)s**|**Juwa jekreis u sa lu semr u paais**|<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>|I'm still writing a new book|
|**sasa kayau(accidentally, by mistake)**|**Lu gauweis sasa kayau**|<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>|I fell accidentally|

:::info
**Vej sa tu das wei tumr vai wei deyayeis** is literally translated as 'NEGATOR more speed which compares to light which is impossible'. 
:::

### ...U + PLACE + PAISE

Another way to convey location in Arusian is by using **U + PLACE + PAISE**. The difference is that this structure draws more attention to the place where the action happens than **U PAYR**. Also, this one is more formal.

**Nepa-naj sa tei tekr u sa umu-pai-tek sa Fna-del paise** (Aren't you studying Astronomy at Fenadel's University?)

<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>

### TEI EDRAS U SA... (THANK YOU FOR...)

This is the sentence structure for saying that someone feels thankful/grateful for an action they did or for something.

**Tei edras u sa tei auwr videyo lus** (Thanks for watching my video!)

<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>

**Tei edras u sa tei tr mez sa lu-pei** (Thanks for coming to our house!)

<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>

### TEI SA [X] KEYELR U SA [Y] (X IS SORRY FOR Y)

This is the sentence structure for saying that someone feels sorry for an action they did or for something.

**Tei sa lu keyelr u sa vej sa nut sa lu deyekr u edr lru** (I'm sorry for not giving the dog food)

<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>

**Tei sa so keyelr u sa vej sa seg sa so kamr** (He is sorry for not having time)

<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>

### CAPITALIZATION RULES (ROMA-SEM)

In Semlek we don't capitalize letters because there's no difference between regular and capital letters. However, this will be shown visually in Roma-sem, usually for proper nouns, such as place, city and country names, personal names and brands.

### PITCH ACCENT IN ARUSIAN

Arusian has a simple system of pitch accent in which some syllables and words are said with a higher pitch than the others. For example, **U** always has a high pitch.

### TO RECEIVE

To express that you receive something from someone, you use the verb **TEYEDR**. The concept of "FROM" is often expressed with the verb **MR**.

**Deyek sa ma lus wei teyedr u mr sai sos** (My mom received a gift from her sister)

<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>

**Vej sa lu teyedras u sa gau-2025** (I didn't receive anything in 2025)

<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>

### WRITING BOOK DIALOGUES

In Arusian, dialogues are usually written this way: we first write what the character said and, in a sentence adjacent to it, you add a dialogue tag.

**! Lu ouwr lu tr mez ! Maria mouwas** ("I want to go home," Maria said)

<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>

Notice that when **!** is used for emphasis, it usually surrounds the sentence and is separated by a space.

### COMPARATIVE

There are two common sentence formulæ for comparing two nouns in Arusian: the first one is **[X] characteristic U TUMR [Y]** and the second one is **[X] characteristic U SA [Y] TUMSE**. The difference between them is the emphasis and the formality.

**Fna-del umuuweis u tumr Luwa-fna** (Fenadel is bigger than Luafena)

<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>

**Luwa-lei sa kut u sa lo-luwa tumse** (A river is smaller than a sea/ocean)

<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>

**Tei trmr vom naais wei sa lu tumse** (You're a worse person than me)

<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>

:::info
In this case WEI is used because **VOM NAAIS** is the predicate of **TUMR**.
:::

### TO BE HAPPY FOR

To express that you're happy for someone, you can use the structure **[X] JUUWEIS U EDR [Y]** if the receiver of someone's happiness is a noun and **[X] JUUWEIS U SA [Y]** if you are stating that someone is happy about a fact. **LRAYEIS** can also be used as a synonym for **JUUWEIS**.

**Anne juuweis u edr ma sus** (Anne is happy for her mother)

<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>

**Lu juuweis u sa tei tr mez lus** (I'm happy because you came to my house)

<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>

**Lu juuweis u sa puk teis wei edse** (I'm happy for your children)

<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>

You can also express this, in a more formal way:

**Tei sa lu juwauwr** (I'm happy for you)

<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>

**Tei sa lu rekr** (I'm proud for you)

<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>

**Fna sos u sa so rekr** (He is proud of his country)

<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>

**REKR** means 'to be proud, to be patriotic'.

:::info
**WEI** is used here because **PUK TEIS** is a clause that is not the topic. Also, **EDSE** is an alternate form of **EDR** that focuses on the receiver/benefactor of the happiness felt. It can also sound more formal and polite and the choice between them will depend on the social situation. You will learn more soon about how formality is shaped by the word order choice.
:::

### FAUWR + NOUN (ANALYTIC INTRANSITIVE VERBS)

To achieve this, we use **FAUWR** with a bare root and they are often synonymous with the intransitive passive verbs (those ending with **~REIS** or **~EIS**).

**Lru fauwr umu** (The dog is in a state of being large/big)

<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>

**Nut fauwr dau** (The food is in a state of being eaten)

<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>

### WORD ORDER AS A MARKER OF SOCIAL STATUS

Word order in Arusian isn't just a matter of preference. It also conveys formality and the degree of respect toward the listener(s). Here we will give you a brief explanation of how this works and in which contexts you will use each word order.

|Order|Roma-sem|Semlek|Anglei-dem|Contexts|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|SVO|**Kaya-dei dauwr nut u payr pai-nut.**|<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>|_Kaya eats food at the restaurant_|Familiar, childish, friendly, informal|
|OSV/Topicalization|**Nut sa Kaya-dei dauwr u payr pai-nut**|<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>|_Kaya eats food at the restaurant_ OR _As for food, Kaya eats it at the restaurant_|Perfect for most situations, usually sounds neutral and formal|
|Verb Initial|**Er-dauwa-nut sa Kaya-dei payr pai-nut** (focus on what's eaten)|<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>| _Kaya eateth the food at the restaurant_ (will be taught in next level)|Highly formal, usually used with the elder and extremely important people|
|Verb Initial|**Er-paya-pai-nut sa Kaya-dei dauwr nut** (focus on location)|<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>| _At the restaurant, Kaya is eating food_ (will be taught in next level)|Highly formal, usually used with the elder and extremely important people|

### WORD BUILDING

Words in Arusian can be built by joining two or more roots (usually separated orthographically by a dash in Roma-sem). The placement of the roots follows some straightforward rules:

- Roots ending in vowels go first.
- **UMU** ugually goes first.
- Monosyllabic roots go first.
- SU and SO obviously go first.
- Intransitive verbs will also go first.

|Roma-sem|Semlek|English|
|---|---|---|
|**UMU-LEI** (big path)|<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>|road|
|**LEI-LUWA** (path water)|<RenderSemlek phrase={"abcdef"}/>|river|
