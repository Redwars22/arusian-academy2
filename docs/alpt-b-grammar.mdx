### NUMBERS

You will easily recognize Arusian numerals because they always have the root **PEI**, used for counting. A fun fact is that most Arusian numerals come from nouns. For example, **KAU** means *insect*, but **PEI-KAU** means *six*. Numbers are flexible and can either precede or follow the noun. Since they behave like nouns too, they need the **SA** copula between the noun and the numeral. Like most world's languages, it is also a base-10 system, so don't worry.

|Roma-Sem|Semlek|Indo-Arabic|
|---|---|---|
|**pei-vej**||0|
|**pei-at**||1|
|**pei-ta**||2|
|**pei-tef**||3|
|**pei-kaf** or **pei-pek**||4|
|**pei-mei** or **pei-kam**||5|
|**pei-kau**||6|
|**pei-aek**||7|
|**pei-lei**||8|
|**pei-ara**||9|
|**pei-ta-mei**||10|

To form numbers between 11 and 19, just add **-DA-TA-MEI** (literally PLUS TWO TIMES FIVE) after the 1-9 digits. For example:

- 19: **pei-ara-da-ta-mei**

- 16: **pei-kau-da-ta-mei**

- 13: **pei-tef-da-ta-mei**

For numbers 20-90, add **-TA-MEI** after 2-9:

- 20: **pei-ta-ta-mei**

- 40: **pei-kaf-ta-mei**

- 90: **pei-ara-ta-mei**

For numbers 21-99, you begin with the 1-9 digits, add **-DA-** and then add the multiples of 10:

- 93: **pei-tef-ara-ta-mei**

- 44: **pei-kaf-da-kaf-ta-mei**

- 33: **pei-tef-da-tef-ta-mei**

100 is **PEI-DEK** and for 200-900 you add the digits 2-9 before **DEK**:

- 300: **pei-tef-dek**

- 500: **pei-mei-dek**


1000 is **PEI-TA-MEI-DEK** (2X5X100).

### WEI IN PREDICATES (SPECIAL PRONOUN)

WEI is a pronoun that adds more information to a clause (what in English are noun phrases are actually clauses in Arusian. For example: big dog is 'the dog is the thing that is big' in Arusian, implying that it is a clause) belonging to a predicate/comment. It is similar to U, but, unlike it, it doesn't add information to a topic.

**Juwa vais u sa vel auwayeis wei pus drejr** (As for the white book, the woman [is the one that is] beautiful [which is the one that is] here bought [it])

This can be loosely translated as the English _which_ or _that_ when they refer back to clauses. Like in: **The book is white, _which_ I find interesting.** While in English this is an emphatic way of speaking, in Arusian this structure is used all the time.

**Nut edse lru vais wei pus** (The food was eaten by the white dog which is here).

**Fai-fai sa Fenadel u trse vom otras wei trmr Asianei** (The forest of Fenadel was visited by many Asian people/by many people which are Asian).

:::info
**Vom otras wei trmr Asianei** is literally translated as 'the people [are the ones who are] many, which are Asian**, which _which_ here refering back to _the people [are the ones who are] many_, which is a clause. 
:::

:::warning
Don't confuse **U** and **WEI** with relative pronouns because they refer back to clauses in Arusian, not nouns.

### IF/ELSE

Arusian has no direct equivalent of the English structure **IF/ELSE**. However, the closest you can get is this:

- First you add the hypothesis, the action that, if or when it occurs, will lead to the second action happening.

- You add **U KEYR** between the first action and the action or event that results from it.

For the sense of **ELSE** (negative result), you add **USU-VEJ SA** to the beginning of the sentence.

Examples:

- **[Tei tekras sasa otra] u keyr [tei sa umrei-ko aemse]. Usu-vej sa [umrei-ko sa tei aemr]** (If you study a lot you will find a job. Else, you won't find a job)

:::warning
The literal translation of this sentence is: 'you studying a lot causes you to be the one for whom a job is found. Otherwise/If no job is the thing that you find'
:::

This structure works best for this kind of situation: action one triggers action or even two. Else, it triggers a negative result.

- **Tei ukreis u keyr pai-uk sa tei agr tei tr. Usu-vej sa tei nouweis** (If you are sick you have to go to the hospital. Or else, you will die)


### VOCATIVES

### FAUWR

The verb **FAUWR** in Arusian is used to express that something is in a certain state. One of the fixed usages of it is with **U FAUWR** for languges. Example:

- **Juwa semreis u fauwr Anglei-dem** (The book was written in English).

In the examples below, it expresses the state in which something is:

**Vom otras u kijras u sa tara-del fauwr** (The capital is in a state of many people vandalizing)

**Leyem umuuweis u sa so-pei fauwr** (They are greatly in a state of love)

**Uwaai sa luwed u sa tara pus wei fauwr** (This city is in a state of being without order)

:::warning
**WEI** is used here because it is modifying a predicate element (a clause) that isn't the topic. The same for the sentence below.
:::

**Tara-del sa luwa waais wei fause** (The capital is in a state of being without water)

### IT HURTS VS SOMEONE HURTS ME

### U EDR...

**U EDR** introduces both the receiver of something and the person who benefits from something. **EDR** on its own is a verb meaning "to help". This is how Arusian expresses the concept of 'to/for'.

**Tei edras u sa tei auwr vidiyo lus** (Thanks for watching my video!)

**Tei edras u sa tei tr mez sa lu-pei** (Thanks for coming to our house!)

### TEI SA [X] KEYELR U SA [Y] (X IS SORRY FOR Y)

**Tei sa so keyelr u sa vej sa seg sa so kamr** (He is sorry for not having time)

### CAPITALIZATION RULES (ROMA-SEM)
