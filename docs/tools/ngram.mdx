# ðŸ§  N-Gram Model (ALPHA)

This is a small chat app for Arusian based on an N-Gram and a database of Arusian sentences. 
It is in a very early stage, and it isn't accurate at all, but feel free to play with it and laugh 
at the weird sentences it generates.

In case this page doesn't load, you can try to access it [here](https://andrewnationdev.github.io/arusian-database/ngrams/kayei-ket.html).
