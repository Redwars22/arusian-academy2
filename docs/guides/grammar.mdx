# Basic Grammar and Sentence Patterns

Coming soon!

## X trmr Y

The easiest way to say that `X is Y` is by using the verb `trmr`, which translates to `equals to`. 
This can only be used for linking two nouns (or at least what would be a noun in English).

- _Lu trmr gru_ (I am a teacher)
- _Nepa-tei trmr vel?_ (Aren't you a woman?)
- _Su trmr puk sa lu-pei_ (She is our child!)

## X sa ["adjective"]/X sa [possessor]

Arusian has no adjectives in the same sense as English, but there are nouns that describe other nouns.
In this case, you cannot use `trmr` to link then. You will use `sa` between the noun and its description if it is a foreign word
or ends in a consonant and `-s` if it is a native root or ends in a vowel.

- _Ared sa tim_ (the world is dark/the dark world)
- _Juwa umus_ (the book is big/a big book)
- _Puk sa kut_ (little child/the child is little)

The `sa` particle also links two nouns to form some kind of association between them (such as expressing possession). Note that you may
only link ONE element to the noun, otherwise you will need to use further linkers (which will be taught later).

- _Lu sa puk_ (my child)
- _Umu juwas_ (the size of the book)
- _Tek grus_ (the lesson of the teacher)
- _Lu sa pai-tek_ (My school/the school I study at)

## X sa Y u ... and X sa Y u sa ...
