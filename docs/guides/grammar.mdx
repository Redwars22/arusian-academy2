# Basic Grammar and Sentence Patterns

Coming soon!

## X trmr Y

The easiest way to say that `X is Y` is by using the verb `trmr`, which translates to `equals to`.
This can only be used for linking two nouns (or at least what would be a noun in English).

- _Lu trmr gru_ (I am a teacher)
- _Nepa-tei trmr vel?_ (Aren't you a woman?)
- _Su trmr puk sa lu-pei_ (She is our child!)

## X sa ["adjective"]/X sa [possessor]

Arusian has no adjectives in the same sense as English, but there are nouns that describe other nouns.
In this case, you cannot use `trmr` to link then. You will use `sa` between the noun and its description (which must be another noun!)
if it is a foreign word or ends in a consonant and `-s` if it is a native root or ends in a vowel.

- _Mai-ared sa tim_ (the world is dark/the dark world)
- _Juwa umus_ (the book is big/a big book)
- _Puk sa kut_ (little child/the child is little)

The `sa` particle also links two nouns to form some kind of association between them (such as expressing possession).
Note that you may
only link ONE element to the noun, otherwise you will need to use further linkers (which will be taught later).

- _Lu sa puk_ (my child)
- _Tem juwas_ (the size of the book)
- _Tek grus_ (the lesson of the teacher)
- _Lu sa pai-tek_ (My school/the school I study at)

## X sa Y u ... and X sa Y u sa ...

Let's suppose you now want to use a noun modified by another word with SA (forming a single "group of words" or, more technically, constituent).
You will need to link it to the rest of the sentence with the help of `u`, which forms a bridge between that group of words and the following words.
Example:

- _Lu sa puk u numreis_ (My child sleeps)

You will need `sa` after `u` if the following word is another noun:

- _Tem juwas u sa gru_ (The size of the book of the teacher)
- _Vek sa tim u umus_ (The big black car) _although in English the order of adjectives is stricter_

:::tip

Another way to memorize `u` is by building two sentences first:

Lu sa puk. Su numreis

And then you join both sentences and replace `su` with `u`. Thus, you get: _lu sa puk u numreis_

:::warning

The element to be linked by _u_ must be part of the subject or topic (what you are talking about). 
Otherwise, if it is part of the predicate, you will have to use _wei_, which will be taught in the next section.

## verb + sasa

## -ei vs -se verbs

## Verbs that "fill the role" of Prepositions
