# ðŸ“– Basic Grammar and Sentence Patterns

This page describes the basics of Arusian grammar and basically all you will need to build
most of the basic sentences in Arusian. Arusian usually prefers small, simple sentences, so
fell free to break a long and complex English sentence into small pieces when trying to express
the same concepts in Arusian.

import { FontRenderer } from "../../src/components/FontRenderer";

## ðŸ“– X TRMR Y

The easiest way to say that `X is Y` is by using the verb `trmr`, which translates to `equals to`.
This can only be used for linking two nouns (or at least what would be a noun in English).

- _Lu trmr gru_ (I am a teacher)

<FontRenderer
    text=". lu trmr gru ."
    rtl
    size="30px"
    color="var(--ifm-color-primary, #794cbd)"
    translit="Lu trmr gru"
/>

- _Nepa-tei trmr vel?_ (Aren't you a woman?)
- _Su trmr puk sa lu-pei_ (She is our child!)

## ðŸ“– X SA ["ADJECTIVE"]/X SA [POSSESSOR]

Arusian has no adjectives in the same sense as English, but there are nouns that describe other nouns.
In this case, you cannot use `trmr` to link then. You will use `sa` between the noun and its description (which must be another noun!)
if it is a foreign word or ends in a consonant and `-s` if it is a native root or ends in a vowel.

- _Mai-ared sa tim_ (the world is dark/the dark world)
- _Juwa umus_ (the book is big/a big book)
- _Puk sa kut_ (little child/the child is little)

The `sa` particle also links two nouns to form some kind of association between them (such as expressing possession).
Note that you may
only link ONE element to the noun, otherwise you will need to use further linkers (which will be taught later).

- _Puk lus_ (my child)
- _Tem juwas_ (the size of the book)
- _Tek grus_ (the lesson of the teacher)
- _Pai-tek lus_ (My school/the school I study at)

## ðŸ“– [X SA Y] U SA Z

Let's suppose you now want to use a noun modified by another word with SA (forming a single "group of words" or, more technically, constituent).
You will need to link it to the rest of the sentence with the help of `u`, which forms a bridge between that group of words and the following words.
Example:

- _Puk lus u numreis_ (My child sleeps)

You will need `sa` after `u` if the following word is another noun:

- _Tem juwas u sa gru_ (The size of the book of the teacher)
- _Vek sa tim u umus_ (The big black car) _although in English the order of adjectives is stricter_

:::tip

Another way to memorize `u` is by building two sentences first:

Puk lus. Su numreis

And then you join both sentences and replace `su` with `u`. Thus, you get: _puk lus u numreis_

:::

:::warning

The element to be linked by _u_ must be part of the subject or topic (what you are talking about). 
Otherwise, if it is part of the predicate, you will have to use _wei_, which will be taught in the next section.

:::

## ðŸ“– [X SA Y] WEI SA Z

The `wei` particle works the same way as `u` (it enables you to link a group of words to the rest of the sentence), 
but `wei` is used when the element is not the topic or the subject of the sentence, 
that is, it is part of the predicate.

- _Lu decr vek sa kut wei sa tim_ (I bought a small black car).

Here, `vek sa kut` follows the `X sa Y` rule, and `tim` (black) must be linked to it. 
By adding `wei`, the whole `vek sa kut` element becomes X, 
and thus it adheres again to the `X sa Y` rule: `[vek sa kut] wei sa tim`. 

:::tip

If you find the usage of `wei` too difficult, just break it into smaller sentences.

:::

- _Lu decr vek sa kut osa tim_ (I bought a small car and it was black).
- _Lu decr vek sa kut. Vek sa tim u osas_ (I bought a small car. The car is black too.)

## ðŸ“– "ADVERBS" AND SASA

The use of `sasa` is very straightforward and often corresponds to English adverbs (specially those that end in -ly). 
It comes before the noun you want to turn into an adverb and it should come after the object or other arguments of the verb.

<FontRenderer
    text=". Ma ta,s u demras sa sa oTra ."
    rtl
    size="33px"
    color="var(--ifm-color-primary, #794cbd)"
    translit="Ma teis u demras sasa otra"
/>
- _Ma teis u demras sasa otra_ (Your dad talks a lot!)

<FontRenderer
    text=". Nepa jua semra,s sa sa tu ."
    rtl
    size="33px"
    color="var(--ifm-color-primary, #794cbd)"
    translit="Nepa-juwa semreis sasa tu?"
/>
- _Nepa-juwa semreis sasa tu?_ (Was the book written quickly?)

## ðŸ“– -R AND -A/-RA VERBS

Those verbs are the equivalent of what we call "active voice" in English. 
 use the **-r** ending if there is an object the subject is acting upon (i.e.: _he writes a book_)
 and **-a** or **-ra** if there is no object (i.e.: _he writes_).

- _Su semr juwa_ (He writes a book, TRANSITIVE)
- _Su semras_ (He writes, INTRANSITIVE)

:::tip

_Semras_ has an -s (a form of the `sa` particle) because intransitive verbs work like nouns and thus follow the `X sa Y` rule.

:::

## ðŸ“– -EI/-REI AND -SE VERBS

These verbs are equivalent to the "passive voice" in English, but, like the previous pair of verbs we learned in the previous section, they have two forms: -se and -rei. The -se form is used when the agent is explicit in the sentence and -rei is for when the object receives the action or is affected by it, but there is no agent. Let's take a look at it:

- _Juwa semse lu_ (the book was written by me)
- _Juwa semreis_ (the book was written)

:::tip

Notice that the -rei verb has an -s after it. It is because -rei verbs, just like -ra ones, work like nouns and thus follow the same `X sa Y` rule.

:::

## ðŸ“– "PREPOSITIONS" (ACTUALLY, VERBS!)

Arusian has no prepositions, so it means that there is no one-to-one match for words like _to, for, with, in, on, at_, etc.
Instead, Arusian uses verbs to convey those ideas. In this section, we will learn some of them.

### ðŸ“• EDR

This verb literally means `to help` and it can also be used to express the receiver of something or the person benefited by an action.

- _Lu decr vek pus u edr tei_ (I bought the car for you/I bought the car to help you)
- _Alicia-dei semr semrei-grau u edr lus_ (Alicia wrote a letter for me)

### ðŸ“• RMR

To express company, you can use this verb meaning `to be together with`, `to accompain`.

- _Lu-pei tr pai-tek u rmr su!_ (We went to school with her)
- _Vej sa tei delr tei kor so u rmr lu!_ (You can't do that with me!)

### ðŸ“• PAYR

This verb means `to be located at` and is used to express most types of location.

- _Lu-pei dauwas u payr resdra_ (We are eating at the restaurant)
- _Marei semr dei teis u payr juwa_ (Write your name on the book)
- _Vej sa Kai-dei payr mez!_ (Kai is not home!)

### ðŸ“• OREMR

The verb `oremr` is used to introduce the tool you use to accomplish an action.

- _Su-pei semr juwa u oremr su-kuweya_ (They write a book using the computer)
- _Tei-pei delr tei-pej decr vreyek u oremr um_ (You guys can buy things with money)

## ðŸ“– "CONJUNCTIONS" IN ARUSIAN

|Conjunction|English|Arusian|
|---|---|---|

## ðŸ“– NEGATIVE SENTENCES

Just add `vej sa` to the beginning of the sentence to make it negative.

## ðŸ“– YES/NO QUESTIONS

Just add `nepa` to turn a sentence or a statement into a yes/no question.
