# ALPT Grammar Corpus

In this page you will find all the grammar topics covered by ALPT exam organized by
the Arusian government and they are ordered by level, with ALPT E being the lowest (equivalent
to A1 in the European language level reference) being the lowest and ALPT A being the highest
(equivalent to C1 and C2 levels in the forementioned guide). Each grammar topic will be followed 
by examples and grammatical explanations for beginners. Whenever possible, we will also provide advanced
linguistic descriptions for sentences for more advanced students and Linguistics enthusiasts.

## ALPT E

### SA AND ~S
Both particles mean the same thing, but they depend on the phonological structure of the root (whether it ends on a consonant or a vowel) and on whether it is a native root, foreign root or a proper noun. They are used in many syntactic structures in Arusian and here we will present some to you.

- **Introduce a Predicate**
SA introduces a predicate, which adds information about the subject, and, in this situation, the closest equivalent to English would be 'to be'. You will attach ~s to the root if it is a native word ending in a vowel. Otherwise, you use SA before the noun, especially if it ends in a consonant, is a foreign word or a proper name. The sentence formula is `X Ys` or `X sa Y`.

**Lru sa tim** (the dog is black)
**Su sa vek** (it is a car)
**Tei pus** (You are here)

- **Link the subject and an intransitive verb**
Intransitive verbs (verbs without an object) will be introduced later, but, it's important for you to know beforehand that SA is used to link it to the subject and this is because they behave like nouns syntactically.

**Lu numreis** (I am sleeping)
**Vek jekreis** (the car is new) 

JEKREIS can be understood as TO BE NEW, instead of just NEW. Word classes don't always match between English and Arusian. 

- **Mark relationships between nouns**
Another useful usage of SA is to link two nouns and convey some sort of relationship or association between them, which can be translated into English as `X of Y`.

**Juwa sa vel** (The book of the woman)
**Nut sa mef** (The food of the animal)
**Kref teis** (Your friend)

## ~RA, ~A (INTRANSITIVE VERBS)
Intransitive verbs in Arusian are used when we have no object the verb is acting upon. That means it simply describes an action like "I write", "you swim", "they sleep", "we drive", etc. There are two kinds of intransitive verbs in Arusian, but for now we will learn the "actor intransitive verbs", which in Arusian grammar means that the subject acts on the action represented by the verb. Not all active verbs in English will necessarily be active in Arusian too, so they must be memorized separately.

Since in Arusian intransitive verbs behave like nouns, you mustn't forget the copula to link the subject to the predicate. Intransitive actor verbs end in -RA, by the way, for most verbs, and sometimes in -A. The general rule is that -RA is used for roots ending in consonants and -A for stems ending in vowels.

**Luka-dei semras** (Lucas is writing)
**Maria-dei dauwas** (Maria is eating)
