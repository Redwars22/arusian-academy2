## Middle Arusian

Middle Arusian is the stage of the Arusian language before the year of 2019. The language underwent few changes
in morphology, but lexicon and syntax changed quite considerably. We will detail some of those here.

### The "Er" letter as tap
The Arusian letter ER is nowadays pronounced as an uvular R sound, like the one found in French, Portuguese (-RR-),
most dialects of High German and Danish. However, between two vowels, it used to be pronounced as a tap, like in the Spanish word **caro** or the English **butter** in some American dialects.

### Linguistic Purism and "European" taboo
Arusian used to have more words borrowed from European languages in the past However, there was a period in Arusia where there was a taboo about everything that was European or of European origin (and that included borrowings). Arusians started replacing them with native Eru roots. Here are some:

|Middle Aru|Modern Arusian|Meaning|Origin|
|---|---|---|---|
|aku|luwa|water|Latin|
|lak|luwa-vai|milk|Latin|
|nei|vej|no, not (**vej** also means _void_)|Unknown, likely Scandinavian|

### Negation with "nei"
Instead of _vej_, a preverbal **nei** was used to negate sentences. The syntax differed considerably here.

- Middle Arusian: **Lu nei ouwr lu decr juwa** (I don't want to buy a book)
- Modern Standard Arusian (Fenadel Dialect): **Vej sa lu ouwr lu decr juwa**
- Modern Arusian (Puerto Lobos): **Veca l'ouwr lu decr juwa**

### Passive Voice and Verb Markers
Verbs in Middle Arusian (the transitive ones) were consistently marked with -r when the subject was the actor and with -s when it was the undergoer (the patient). The agent in **patient trigger verbs** was introduced by the **er** particle, which over time fused into the root of the verb and yielded the modern **-se** ending for **transitive patient trigger verbs**.  

- Middle Arusian: **Juwa decus er lu** (The book was bought by me)
- Modern Standard Arusian (Fenadel Dialect): **Juwa decse lu**
- Modern Arusian (Puerto Lobos): **Juwa  deces lu**
