This post aims to investigate how word order in Arusian, which is considerably freer
than English, affects formality and characterises colloquial and formal registers.

## INTRANSITIVE VERBS
Arusian distinguishes transitivity and voice in verbs morphologically.

Intransitive verbs are characterised by the morphemes **-a** and **-ei** 
(depending on the voice). 
Later, we will see that they often function as nouns, and not as verbs. 
We will explain why this happens.

### DO INTRANSITIVES VERBS BEHAVE LIKE NOUNS?

There is a theory that intransitive verbs behave and act syntactically
like nouns. For example, when they modify the subject, they can join the genitive particle
**sa** (or its enclitic version **-s**). Only nouns in Aru can receive this particle.
Therefore, we theorize that intransitive verbs are, in reality, nouns.

### SV ORDER

For intransitive verbs, there is no distinction of formality according to the order in which
the verb and subject appear. It is common for the subject to come before the verb in these
types of phrases.

import { FontRenderer } from "../src/components/FontRenderer";

<FontRenderer size="32px" color="var(--ifm-color-primary, #794cbd)" text=". s,armuN ul ."/>

> **Lu numreis** `I sleep`

Here, NUMREI kind of describes the pronoun LU, which is why it receives the genitive 
particle.

### VS ORDER

When we want to emphasize the action, we can put the verb before the pronoun or noun 
it refers to. This does not change the formality.

<FontRenderer size="32px" color="var(--ifm-color-primary, #794cbd)" text=". sul ,armuN ."/>

> **Numrei lus** `I sleep`

## TRANSITIVE VERBS
Here, the situation becomes too complex, because word order influences formality 
and register.

### IS THERE A NEUTRAL WORD ORDER?
Is there a neutral word order in Aru that doesn't seem too formal or
too informal?
For transitive verbs (those ending in **-r** or **-se**), the most neutral order is
OSV (the object precedes the subject and the verb)

### OSV

This is the most neutral order in Aru and is used in many contexts, such as on television, 
in academic texts or articles, or even when speaking with unknown people. 
We can also find it in street advertisements or street signs.

<FontRenderer size="32px" color="var(--ifm-color-primary, #794cbd)" text=". road ul as TuN ."/>

> **Nut sa lu dauwr** `I eat food`

NUT is the object of the verb and means "food". 
In Aru there is a greater preference for the topicalization of the object.

### VOS

This is a rarer word order in Aru and is used when speaking to the king, to the queen, 
in traditional ceremonies, when speaking to your grandparents, in religious texts or 
speeches, etc. The verb also changes when moved to the beginning of the sentence and 
has a special form: we add the prefix **er-** and the suffix **-a**. 
The object comes after the verb. The subject receives the attributive/genitive particle.

<FontRenderer size="32px" color="var(--ifm-color-primary, #794cbd)" text=". sul TuN auad ,r ."/>

> **Erdauwa-nut lus** `I eat food` (you would say this to the king, for example).

:::warning
The VOS order only appears in declarative sentences. 
In questions, you must use the OSV order.

### SVO
This is the most common order in informal situations when you talk to a friend, your child,
a person very close to you. But beware! You should not use it in writing or when
talking to someone hierarchically superior to you.

<FontRenderer size="32px" color="var(--ifm-color-primary, #794cbd)" text=". TuN road ul ."/>

> **Lu dauwr nut** `I eat food`

### QUESTIONS
We already know that questions cannot be asked using the VOS order because one of the 
interrogative particles
(**puwei, nepa and plei**) must be close to the noun you are asking about. 
It is impossible for it to be in front of a verb. 
Therefore, the puwei-OSV or puwei-SVO orders are the only options in questions.
