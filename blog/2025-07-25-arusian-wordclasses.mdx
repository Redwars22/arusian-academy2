Arusian classifies words in a different way from European languages and it has
fewer categories. Prepositions, adjectives, and conjunctions don't really exist
in Arusian and their roles might be replaced by co-verbs or intransitive verbs.
In this post we will show you two different views on Arusian word classes according
to their morphosyntactic behavior in sentences.

# Trerotola's Classification

# Andrew's Classification
Andrew proposes a different way to classify Arusian words.

- **NOMINALS**: this class includes nouns, intransitive verbs (that work like nouns), pronouns (personal pronouns and U and WEI).
- **PARTICLES**: little words that help with sentence flow, connect words and express certain notions. For example, **PUWEI** connects to a noun to make a question about it (i.e.: **PUWEI-PAI** *which place*), **NEPA** turns a statement into a yes/no question, **SA** connects two nouns and **PLEI** is used for polite requests.
- **DESCRIPTIVES**: Arusian doesn't have a class of adjectives, but descriptives kind of fill their role. There are two types of descriptives. The first one is _nominal descriptive_, which describes nouns and usually get the -s ending when the root ends with a vowel. If it ends with a consonant, then the particle **SA** must be used instead. Native and foreign roots behave differently in Arusian, especially within this class. On the other hand, _verbal descriptives_ describe verbs and explain how an action happens (kind of like adverbs in English) and they are introduced by **SASA**. i.e.: *jekrei* (to be new) becomes *sasa jekreis* (again). Nouns can be turned into _verbal descriptives_ by adding **SASA** in front of them.
- **VERBS**: these are true transitive verbs that are either active or passive. They end with -R or -SE and differ from nouns in the fact that they can never take -s.
