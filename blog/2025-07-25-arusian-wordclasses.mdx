Arusian classifies words in a different way from European languages and it has
fewer categories. Prepositions, adjectives, and conjunctions don't really exist
in Arusian and their roles might be replaced by co-verbs or intransitive verbs.
In this post we will show you two different views on Arusian word classes according
to their morphosyntactic behavior in sentences.

# Trerotola's Classification

# Andrew's Classification
Talking about adjectives, here is my proposal for word class categories in Arusian (they dont necessarily follow standard linguistics practices):

- Nominals (includes nouns, intransitive verbs, pronouns, U and WEI).
- Particles (things that help with sentence flow and express certain notions, 
like PUWEI, NEPA, SA, PLEI)
- Descriptives (words that describe others. We have two types here: 
NOMINAL DESCRIPTIVES, which get either -S or SA, and VERBAL DESCRIPTIVES, 
which get SASA. 
They simply describe and add more information)
- Verbs (active verbs with -R and -SE. These are true verbs and cannot take SA or -S)
