This post is the second out of a series of posts on which we will compare Arusian to some
Asian languages to test and seek features that might be similar. In this post, we will
be comparing Arusian to Cantonese by taking into consideration five main features:

- Morphology and word building
- Topic-Comment syntax
- Adpositions
- Relative Clauses
- Copula

## Morphology and Word building

Both Arusian and Cantonese are highly analytic (just like Vietnamese, as we saw in the last post) 
and form words by putting two or more roots
side by side to create more complex words. Also, the concept of what might be a word in those
languages may differ significantly from what is a word in English.

Let's compare how those languages form words:

??? use the example of school here

## Topic-Comment syntax

In Cantonese, Topic-Comment (T-C) is a common sentence structure where the topic is 
introduced first, often followed by a pause, and then a comment is made about that topic. 
It's like saying "As for X, Y is true."
The same is true for Arusian and Vietnamese.

<Glossing data={[
    { word: 'Juwa', gloss: 'book' },
    { word: 'fus', gloss: 'that-LINK' },
    { word: 'u sa', gloss: 'TOP LINK' },
    { word: 'lu', gloss: 'I' },
    { word: 'puwauwr', gloss: 'read' }
  ]}
    translation={"As for the book, I've read it"}
    title="Arusian"/>

<Glossing data={[
    { word: 'go2', gloss: 'that' },
    { word: 'bun2 syu1', gloss: 'CL book' },
    { word: 'ngo5', gloss: 'I' },
    { word: 'tai2 zo2', gloss: 'read-PERF' },
  ]}
    nativeScript={["嗰", "本書", "我", "睇咗"]}
    showNativeScript
    translation={"As for the book, I've read it"}
    title="Cantonese"/>

## Adpositions
Arusian and Cantonese use verbs to express the same notion expressed by prepositions in
English. As such, prepositions don't really exist in either language.

<Glossing data={[
    { word: 'Lu', gloss: 'I' },
    { word: 'semr', gloss: 'write' },
    { word: 'juwa', gloss: 'book' },
    { word: 'u', gloss: 'REL' },
    { word: 'oremr', gloss: 'use' },
    { word: 'tai', gloss: 'pencil' }
  ]}
    translation={'I write a book with a pencil'}
    title="Arusian"/>

<Glossing data={[
    { word: 'ngo5', gloss: 'I' },
    { word: 'jung6', gloss: 'use' },
    { word: 'jyun4 bat1', gloss: 'pencil' },
    { word: 'se2', gloss: 'write' },
    { word: 'jat1', gloss: 'one' },
    { word: 'bun2 syu1', gloss: 'CL book' }
  ]}
    nativeScript={["我", "用", "鉛筆", "寫", "一", "本書"]}
    showNativeScript
    translation={'I write a book with a pencil'}
    title="Cantonese"/>

## Relative Clauses
Arusian uses a post-nominal relative clause introduced by a relativizer _wei_, 
although we can find other relativizers or linking particles like _u_ or _sa_. 
In the following example, the relative clause follows the noun it modifies, 
and _wei_ marks the relationship. In Cantonese, on the other hand, the relative clause 
precedes the head noun. The particle **嘅** (ge3) functions as a possessive/attributive 
marker that links the modifying clause to the head noun. This structure is similar to 
how adjectives precede nouns in many languages.

<Glossing data={[
    { word: 'Cantonese', gloss: 'Cantonese' },
    { word: 'trmr', gloss: 'be' },
    { word: 'dem', gloss: 'language' },
    { word: 'wei', gloss: 'REL' },
    { word: 'lu', gloss: 'I' },
    { word: 'tekr', gloss: 'study' }
  ]}
    translation={'Cantonese is the language that I study'}
    title="Arusian"/>

<Glossing data={[
    { word: 'gwong2 dung1 waa2', gloss: 'Guangdong-speech' },
    { word: 'hai6', gloss: 'COP' },
    { word: 'ngo5', gloss: 'I' },
    { word: 'hok6', gloss: 'study' },
    { word: 'ge3', gloss: 'of' },
    { word: 'ju5 jin4', gloss: 'language' }
  ]}
    nativeScript={["廣東話", "係", "我", "學", "嘅", "語言"]}
    showNativeScript
    translation={'Cantonese is the language that I study'}
    title="Cantonese"/>

## Copula
In Arusian, the word **trmr** serves to link two nouns and convey a sense of equivalence, 
much like the verb `to be` in English. Similarly, Cantonese uses **係** (hai6) for the same purpose. 
This cannot be used for "adjectives", just nouns. Also, Cantonese uses another copula for 
location (**喺** hai2), which is equivalent to Arusian **payr**, which is not considered a copula.

- Example 1 (Equative copula)

<Glossing data={[
    { word: 'Lu', gloss: 'I' },
    { word: 'trmr', gloss: 'be' },
    { word: 'Chinese', gloss: 'Chinese' }
  ]}
    translation={'I am Chinese'}
    title="Arusian"/>

<Glossing data={[
    { word: 'ngo5', gloss: 'I' },
    { word: 'hai6', gloss: 'be' },
    { word: 'zung1 gwok3 jan4', gloss: 'middle-country-person' },
  ]}
    nativeScript={["我", "係", "中國人"]}
    showNativeScript
    translation={'I am Chinese'}
    title="Cantonese"/>

- Example 2 (Locative copula)

<Glossing data={[
    { word: 'Lu', gloss: 'I' },
    { word: 'payr', gloss: 'be-at' },
    { word: 'pai-tek', gloss: 'place-study' }
  ]}
    translation={'I am at school'}
    title="Arusian"/>

<Glossing data={[
    { word: 'ngo5', gloss: 'I' },
    { word: 'hai2', gloss: 'be-at' },
    { word: 'hok2 haau6', gloss: 'study-place' },
  ]}
    nativeScript={["我", "喺", "學校"]}
    showNativeScript
    translation={'I am at school'}
    title="Cantonese"/>
