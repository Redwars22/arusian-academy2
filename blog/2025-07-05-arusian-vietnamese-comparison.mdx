This post is the first out of a series of posts on which we will compare Arusian to some
Asian languages to test and seek features that might be similar. In this post, we will
be comparing Arusian to Vietnamese by taking into consideration five main features:

- Morphology and word building
- Topic-Comment syntax
- Adpositions
- Relative Clauses
- Copula

<!-- truncate -->

## Morphology and Word building

Both Arusian and Vietnamese are highly analytic and form words by putting two or more roots
side by side to create more complex words. Also, the concept of what might be a word in those
languages may differ significantly from what is a word in English.

Let's compare how those languages form words:

Example 1:
- Vietnamese: **Xe đạp** ("bicycle" < vehicle + pedal)
- Arusian: **Vek-jeg** ("bicycle" < vehicle + leg)

Example 2:
- Vietnamese: **Sách giáo khoa** ("textbook" < book + teaching)
- Arusian: **Juwa-tek** ("textbook" < book + study)

## Topic-Comment syntax

We will be dwelving first into the realm of Topic-Comment. What is topic-comment afterall?
Well, it is nothing more than a way of organizing elements in a sentence, based on what are
we talking about and then commenting about that thing. This structure is found in several
languages, out of which we can name Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, Hungarian, Portuguese, etc.

In both Arusian and Vietnamese, elements can be moved to the left periphery of the sentence 
(aka _the beginning of the sentence_, in less technical terms) to be focused and become the topic
of the sentence. Let's see an example:

import Glossing from '../src/components/Glossing.tsx'

<Glossing data={[
    { word: 'juwa', gloss: 'book' },
    { word: 'pu-s', gloss: 'here-LINK' },
    { word: 'u', gloss: 'REL.TOP' },
    { word: 'sa', gloss: 'PRED.LINK' },
    { word: 'lu', gloss: 'I' },
    { word: 'puwauwr', gloss: 'read.TRANS' },
  ]}
    translation={'As for this book, I read it'}
    title="Arusian"/>

<Glossing data={[
    { word: 'sách', gloss: 'book' },
    { word: 'này', gloss: 'this' },
    { word: 'thì', gloss: 'TOP' },
    { word: 'tôi', gloss: 'I' },
    { word: 'đọc', gloss: 'read' }
  ]}
    translation={'As for this book, I read it'}
    title="Vietnamese"/>

## Adpositions
Arusian and Vietnamese use verbs to express the same notion expressed by prepositions in
English. As such, prepositions don't really exist in either language.

<Glossing data={[
    { word: 'Tra pus', gloss: 'today' },
    { word: 'u sa', gloss: 'REL.TOP LINK' },
    { word: 'lu vekras', gloss: 'I drive-car-TRANS.LINK' },
    { word: 'wei', gloss: 'REL' },
    { word: 'tr', gloss: 'go.TRANS' },
    { word: 'Veyet-fna', gloss: 'Vietnam' }
  ]}
    translation={'As for today, I drive the car to Vietnam'}
    title="Arusian"/>

<Glossing data={[
    { word: 'Hôm nay', gloss: 'today' },
    { word: 'tôi', gloss: 'I' },
    { word: 'lái xe', gloss: 'drive-car' },
    { word: 'đến', gloss: 'arrive' },
    { word: 'Viêt Nam', gloss: 'Vietnam' }
  ]}
    translation={'As for today, I drive the car to Vietnam'}
    title="Vietnamese"/>

## Relative Clauses
In Vietnamese, relative clauses follow the noun they modify, but there is often no 
connector or relative pronoun. 
In Arusian, connectors such as _u_, _sa_, or _wei_ are used as relative pronouns or linkers. 

<Glossing data={[
    { word: 'lu', gloss: 'I' },
    { word: 'ouwr', gloss: 'like-TRANS' },
    { word: 'lru', gloss: 'dog' },
    { word: 'sa', gloss: 'LINK' },
    { word: 'kluwa aj', gloss: 'color red' },
  ]}
    translation={'I like the dog that is red'}
    title="Arusian"/>

<Glossing data={[
    { word: 'con chó', gloss: 'CL dog' },
    { word: 'tôi', gloss: 'I' },
    { word: 'yêu', gloss: 'like' },
    { word: 'màu đỏ', gloss: 'color-red' }
  ]}
    translation={'I like the dog that is red'}
    title="Vietnamese"/>

## Copula
In Arusian, the word **trmr** serves to link two nouns and convey a sense of equivalence, 
much like the verb `to be` in English. Similarly, Vietnamese uses **là** for the same purpose. 
This cannot be used for "adjectives", just nouns.

<Glossing data={[
    { word: 'Mai-dei', gloss: 'Mai-PROP.NOUN' },
    { word: 'trmr', gloss: 'COP' },
    { word: 'so-tekra', gloss: 'AGENT-study-INTR' }
  ]}
    translation={'Mai is a student'}
    title="Arusian"/>

<Glossing data={[
    { word: 'Mai', gloss: 'Mai' },
    { word: 'là', gloss: 'COP' },
    { word: 'sinh viên', gloss: 'student' },
  ]}
    translation={'Mai is a student'}
    title="Vietnamese"/>

## Conclusion

> "Vietnamese and arusian share an analytic grammar and syntax, as in both languages, 
morphemes are put together like Lego to build more complex words. The grammar differs slightly, 
as Arusian employs more linkers and relative pronouns. Despite these minor differences, 
both languages organize information in a similar way and also build sentences similarly," Juweya.
